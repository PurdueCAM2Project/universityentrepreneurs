Entrepreneurship in Universities
================================

In recent years, many universities promote entrepreneurship and have
many activities.  Many universities do not explicitly explain why they
support entrepreneurship activities.

Universities Are Good for Entrepreneurship Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The academic structures in typical universities are good for
entrepreneurship activities, for example,

- The students in the same cohort take similar courses and spend
  considerable amounts of time together.  Students can find partners
  among the same cohort.

- Even students in the same cohort may take a wide range of courses
  and build teams of diverse talents.

- Many universities have research programs, in addition to teaching,
  and can create new technologies for medicine, chemical processes,
  information and communication, mechanical devices, and many more.


Universities Are Bad for Entrepreneurship Activities

Many reasons also make universities bad places for entrepreneurship
activities. The existing academic structures can be harmful to
cultivate the minds of entrepreneurs.

- Students and professors are used to semester (or quarter in some
  universities) system: Each course lasts only 15 weeks; after 15
  weeks grades are given and everything is forgotten. Everything gets
  refresh start the next semester. Unfortunately, 15 weeks are too
  short for solving complex problems.  Students and professors are not
  used to solving large and difficult problems.

- Due to the short duration of each semester, homework assignments and
  exam questions must not be too challenging.

- For large classes, it would be difficult to accommodate the needs
  and strengths of individual students. Instructors usually have to
  rely on assignments and exams questions that have "correct" answers.
  Such practice may discourage creativity. In fact, many exams rely on
  multiple-choice questions and discourage students from creating new
  answers other than the few given by the instructors.

- Many instructors, for the purpose of encouraging learning, give
  "partial credits": giving some points to a student if the student's
  answer is wrong but somewhat related to correct
  answers. Unfortunately, in the "real world", many people (customers)
  do not purchase products with slight defects, even at lower prices.
  Would you board an airplane that leaks fuel and the airlines give
  you 20% discount? Would you buy a sedan with one flat tire even
  though the dealer gives you 25% discount? The concept of partial
  credits can hurt students' thinking.

- Students in each deparment usually take similar courses. They have
  similar skills and do not have good opportunities knowing people in
  other departments with different skills.

- GPA (Grade Point Average) is widely used to evaluate students'
  understanding of the subjects. GPA encourages students to pay
  attention to every subjects, not to focus on any specific topic at
  the expense of low grades in other subjects.
