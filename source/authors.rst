     - Yung-Hsiang Lu is a professor in the School of Electrical and
       Computer Engineering at Purdue University, West Lafayette,
       Indiana, USA.  He is a Distinguished Scientist and
       Distinguished Speaker of the ACM (Association for Computing
       Machinery).  He led a team that received an Innovation Corps
       (I-Corps) grant from the National Science Foundation
       (IIP-1530914 "Business Analytics for Large Scale
       Intelligence"). In 2015, Dr. Lu and three Purdue students
       started a technology company using video analytics in physical
       stores to improve customer experience. This company received
       Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) from the National
       Science Foundation Phase I (IIP-1622082) and Phase II
       (IIP-1738492). In December 2018, the company received a Black
       Award from Elevate Purdue Foundry Fund. In 2019-2021, Dr. Lu is
       the Engineering Dean's Fellow in Entrepreneurship coordinating
       the entrepreneurship programs on Purdue campus.  In 2019, he
       obtained the Outstanding VIP-Based Entrepreneurship Award from
       the VIP (Vertically Integrated Project) Consortium for his
       contributions promoting entrepreneurship in VIP teams.  He
       obtained the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from
       Stanford University

     - George K. Thiruvathukal is a professor in Computer Science at
       Loyola University Chicago and a visiting professor at Argonne
       National Laboratory.  His research areas include
       high-performance computing, distributed systems, and software
       engineering with an emphasis on techniques to support parallel
       and distributed programming using modern software engineering
       practices, languages, and paradigms (e.g. object-oriented
       design and functional programming), cyber-physical systems,
       history of computing, computational and data science (applied
       to science and humanities problems), computing education,
       broadening participation, and social/societal issues in
       computing.  He obtained the Ph.D. degree from the Illinois
       Institute of Technology.
