<h1>Entrepreneurship in Universities<a class="headerlink" href="#entrepreneurship-in-universities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In recent years, many universities promote entrepreneurship and have
many activities.  Many universities do not explicitly explain why they
support entrepreneurship activities.</p>
<div class="section" id="universities-are-good-for-entrepreneurship-activities">
<h2>Universities Are Good for Entrepreneurship Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#universities-are-good-for-entrepreneurship-activities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The academic structures in typical universities are good for
entrepreneurship activities, for example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The students in the same cohort take similar courses and spend
considerable amounts of time together.  Students can find partners
among the same cohort.</p></li>
<li><p>Even students in the same cohort may take a wide range of courses
and build teams of diverse talents.</p></li>
<li><p>Many universities have research programs, in addition to teaching,
and can create new technologies for medicine, chemical processes,
information and communication, mechanical devices, and many more.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="universities-are-bad-for-entrepreneurship-activities">
<h2>Universities Are Bad for Entrepreneurship Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#universities-are-bad-for-entrepreneurship-activities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many reasons also make universities bad places for entrepreneurship
activities. The existing academic structures can be harmful to
cultivate the minds of entrepreneurs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Students and professors are used to semester (or quarter in some
universities) system: Each course lasts only 15 weeks; after 15
weeks grades are given and everything is forgotten. Everything gets
refresh start the next semester. Unfortunately, 15 weeks are too
short for solving complex problems.  Students and professors are not
used to solving large and difficult problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to the short duration of each semester, homework assignments and
exam questions must not be too challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>For large classes, it would be difficult to accommodate the needs
and strengths of individual students. Instructors usually have to
rely on assignments and exams questions that have “correct” answers.
Such practice may discourage creativity. In fact, many exams rely on
multiple-choice questions and discourage students from creating new
answers other than the few given by the instructors.</p></li>
<li><p>Many instructors, for the purpose of encouraging learning, give
“partial credits”: giving some points to a student if the student’s
answer is wrong but somewhat related to correct
answers. Unfortunately, in the “real world”, many people (customers)
do not purchase products with slight defects, even at lower prices.
Would you board an airplane that leaks fuel and the airlines give
you 20% discount? Would you buy a sedan with one flat tire even
though the dealer gives you 25% discount? The concept of partial
credits can hurt students’ thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Students in each deparment usually take similar courses. They have
similar skills and do not have good opportunities knowing people in
other departments with different skills.</p></li>
<li><p>GPA (Grade Point Average) is widely used to evaluate students’
understanding of the subjects. GPA encourages students to pay
attention to every subjects, not to focus on any specific topic at
the expense of low grades in other subjects.</p></li>
</ul>
